You’ve never seen an Arduino™ compatible like this. With a built-in OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode Display) you can see what your Arduino is thinking without having to connect it to your computer.  No more cryptic “Hello World” LED blink sequences or shoehorning oversized displays onto your tiny Arduino™. Development is much easier when you can see what’s going on."},{"title":404,"url":"/404.html","date":null,"categories":[],"body":""},{"title":null,"url":"/index.html","date":null,"categories":[],"body":""},{"title":"Getting Started with MicroView","url":"/example/2014/05/04/getting-started","date":"2014-05-04 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["example"],"body":"In order to get your MicroView up and running you’ll need the latest version of the Arduino software available from the Arduino Website. The Arduino software (also known as the Arduino IDE), lets you program you MicroView (and other Arduinos).  To get the Arduino software visit: arduino.cc/en/main/software. Use the MicroView USB programmer or FTDI cable to connect your MicroView to one of your computer’s USB ports. The MicroView USB programmer uses a special FTDI chip to convert the signals from your computer’s USB port into serial signals compatible with your MicroView. This FTDI chip requires special drivers to be installed on your computer. Head over to the FTDI site. Look on the left side for ‘Drivers,’ and then choose ‘VCP Drivers’. Now we need to determine if you need the x86 or x64 bit version of the drivers. Click on the apple icon in the top left of the screen, and choose ‘About this Mac’. Check under ‘Processor’ to see which version you have. Follow the chart below to determine which drivers to download. Download the files from the site by clicking on the link. Locate the .dmg file that was downloaded to your computer, and double click on it. If you are not sure which version of OS X you have, use the same process as before when finding the processor type. Click on the apple and choose ‘About This Mac’. You will then see Version 10.X.Y–use the 10.X to determine your system version. Continue through the installation, and wait for it to finish. Then click ‘Close.’ Your MicroView and the Arduino UNO are interchangeable but you won’t find the MicroView listed in the Arduino Software. Select “Arduino UNO” instead."},{"title":"General Overview of MicroView","url":"/intro/2014/06/04/general-overview-of-microview","date":"2014-06-04 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["intro"],"body":" The MicroView is the first chip-sized Arduino compatible that lets you see what your Arduino is thinking using a built-in OLED display. In the heart of MicroView there is an ATMEL’s ATmega328P, 5V & 3.3V LDO and a 64x48 pixel OLED display, together with other passive components that allow the MicroView to operate without any external components other than a power supply.  The SSD1306 is the controller built-in the MicroView’s OLED.  It has flexible yet complex segment and common drivers.  One requires vast knowledge on memory addressing in order to use the SSD1306 controller. MicroView’s library was written to wrap around the complexities of the SSD1306 controller, so that user can issue simple commands to control the display. Although the SSD1306 has a built-in RAM (memory) for the screen, when connected using the SPI method, ATmega328P is not able to read the RAM (memory) of the SSD1306. Therefore the software will not be able to manipulate the screen memory to perform mathematical operation on the screen memory. MicroView’s library overcome this by allocating a 384 bytes ( (64 x 48)/8 bits) of memory from ATmega328P as buffer. The library can now manipulates the buffer memory and then perform a bulk transfer from the ATmega328P’s memory to the internal memory of the SSD1306 controller.  The 384 bytes of buffer memory are declared in MicroView’s library as and are arranged in a linear form representing the following 64 x 48 pixels coordinate system.  Based on the above illustration, for example, if a user wish to plot a pixel at the position of the black dot, where X=10 and Y=2, user issue the following command: This command will then calculate the exact location of the buffer memory and set a BIT in the BYTE corresponding to the X,Y position. Diagram showing how a linear buffer memory in the ATmega328P aligns with the OLED pixels. Diagram showing the BITs in a BYTE of the buffer memory corresponding to the OLED’s X,Y position. Based on the above illustration, a pixel turned on at X=2 and Y=3 means BYTE 2 of the buffer memory has a data of 0x08 (hex).  Two pixels at X=2,Y=3 and X=2,Y=2 turned on means BYTE 2 of the buffer memory has a data of 0x0c (hex). To draw a straight line of 5 pixels starting from 10,2 to 10,2 , the following C codes show a simple way on how to accomplish this. In order for the library to perform extremely fast draw (more than 100 frames per second), all drawing function in the MicroView’s library does not immediately transfer the buffer memory to the SSD1306 controller. A display() command is required to instruct the library to perform the bulk transfer from the buffer memory to the SSD1306 controller: This function take the whole buffer memory in the ATmega328P and transfer them via SPI bus (programmed at 8Mhz) to the internal memory of the SSD1306. As soon as the memory is being transferred, the pixels corresponding to the buffer memory will show up on the OLED."}]}
